# Hugo

Hugo was a very ambitious project, and I have worked on this day and night.

Over 2000 lines of code.

In other words, a lot.

## Tips

Signs give hints
All NPCs will need your help
You can interact with props. You just need to find the prop, usually found at a convinent location.

## What I wanted for Hugo that I couldn't achieve

- Better code base
- Better Sprites & Music
- More levels (incl. boss fight)
- More interactability
